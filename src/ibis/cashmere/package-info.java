/**
 * The Cashmere package provides support for running divide-and-conquer programs

 * <p>
 * Cashmere extends Java with two simple Cilk-like primitives for
 * divide-and-conquer programming.  The Cashmere byte-code rewriter and
 * runtime system cooperate to implement these primitives efficiently on
 * a distributed system, using work stealing to distribute the jobs.
