/**
 * Cashmere is a library on top of <a href="https://github.com/NLeSC/Constellation">Constellation</a> that schedules
 * <a href="https://github.com/JungleComputing/mcl">Many-Core Levels (MCL)</a> kernels efficiently.
 *
 * While Constellation is responsible for scheduling {@link ibis.constellation.Activity Activities} onto nodes in the cluster,
 * Cashmere operates on the level of one node. It is responsible for scheduling many-core kernels efficiently to many-core devices
 * in the node, such as GPUs. The main class for a Cashmere program is {@link ibis.cashmere.constellation.Cashmere} that only has
 * static methods. For a typical setup of Cashmere we refer to the {@link ibis.cashmere.constellation.Cashmere} class.
